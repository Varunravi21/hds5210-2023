The grading rubric for the final can be found in GitHub: https://github.com/paulboal/hds5210-2023/blob/main/final/final-instructions.pdf

**Functional Requirements**
* 5 points - Uses data from at least two different sources: local file, internet, web service, relational database, AWS S3, etc; and formats: CSV, JSON, database, XML, Excel, etc

* 5 points - Data is aggregated or pivoted at least twice during the program
* 5 points - Some kind of field-level transformation is performed at least 5 times
* 5 points - The program creates 3 or more data visualizations 
* 5 points - The program serves a theoretical purpose described in documentation, that could potentially do something in healthcare or another industry of interest

**Modularity / Style**
* 15 points - The code is broken up into various functions or classes to make testing and reuse easier

**Documentation and Professionalism**
* 15 points - All functions are documented and notebook cells include annotations and explanations.

**(-1) Generic variable names like `data_1` or `data_2` are not acceptable.  They make it hard for the reader to understand what is going on and what this variable refers to.**

**Note that to use heading formats in markdown, you need a space between the hash symbol and the heading: `## Heading`**

**Overall, I found your project a little bit hard to follow.  I think it could have used some clearer / cleaner headers and formatting.  You met the requirments and shares ome god insights.  Nice work!**
